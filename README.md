# Easycard üì¨  
*A Fullstack SPA for Sending Personalized Postcards via Real Mail*

![Easycard Architecture](public/images/stackathonWhiteBoard.png)

## Overview

**Easycard** is a mobile-first, single page application (SPA) for creating and sending customized postcards through real-world direct mail services. This project is designed, built, and maintained entirely by me ‚Äî Melinda Armbruster ‚Äî as part of my Fullstack Academy self-study capstone. I continue to evolve the app for potential commercial release.

This is a fully integrated, end-to-end application connecting a modern front-end, a Node.js backend, a PostgreSQL database, and multiple third-party APIs including Lob (for direct mail), Stripe (for payment processing), and Google OAuth (for authentication).

## Features

- üì∏ **Browse & Customize Postcards**  
  A dynamic gallery allows users to select and personalize postcard templates using a responsive React/Redux interface.

- üí≥ **Pay with Stripe**  
  Seamless payment flow through the Stripe API allows users to complete their order with a credit card.

- üì¨ **Send Real Mail via Lob API**  
  The app integrates with the Lob Direct Mail API to send postcards to real mailing addresses. Users receive visual confirmation of the exact printed postcard.

- üß† **User Authentication with Google OAuth**  
  Google login provides a secure and user-friendly authentication mechanism.

- üîÑ **Fullstack Data Flow**  
  Efficient back-to-back API calls on the server coordinate the Stripe charge and Lob printing while storing postcard templates, orders, and API responses in a PostgreSQL database.

  - Handles API orchestration (Lob, Stripe, Google)
  - Manages business logic and database communication
  - Uses Sequelize ORM for secure data access

- **PostgreSQL Database:**
  - Stores HTML postcard templates
  - Tracks orders and their status
  - Records responses from the Lob API
